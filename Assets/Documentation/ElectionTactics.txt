Election Tactics
----------------

1. To Do

1.1 General Gameplay
	- Add year display and year mechanics:
		- Instead of "Election", the button sais "End Year"
		- Each year you get 1 PP
		- Each year you get 1 CP
		- Each year there is 1 event
		- Each year there is 1 constitution vote
		- There is a general election every 4 years (can be changed through constitution)

1.2 Constitution
	- Add constitution tab in header
	- Constitution is readonly information about current game rules
	- Consitution describes following points:
		- Captial (yes / no, # bonus seats)
		- Seat distribution (minimum seats per district, population per seat, scaling population requirement)
		- Constitution voting system (one vote per party, one vote per seat, one vote per district), (how many votes per cycle)
		- District addition system (one district per cycle, no more districts)
		- District voting system (winner takes it all, proportionally, alternative vote)
		- Bans (on economies, religions, etc)

1.3 Events tab
	- Add an event tab in header

	1.3.1 Constitution voting
		- Each election cycle there's a random vote on a change in the constitution
		- Add interactive display to vote

	1.3.2 Event
		- Each election cycle there's a random event happening
		- More events can be forced with campaigns
		- Add readonly event display with detailed description

1.4 Campaigns tab
	- Add campaigns tab in header
	- Campaigns can be chosen with campaign points (CP)
	- Each cycle there are three campaigns that can be chosen from
	- Campaigns can have different costs according to the severity of their impact
	- Campaigns can be locked for later for 1 campaign point
	- Campaigns can be rerolled for 1 campaign point
	- Examples of campaigns:
		- Propaganda campaigns - Add a positive modifier for your party in a chosen district for a certain time
		- Diffarmation campaigns - Add a negative or exclusion modifier to a chosen enemy party in a chosen district for a certain time
		- District campaigns - Split or exclude a district from the game
		- Force event campaigns - Force a certain random event for the next cycle
		- Constitution vote campaigns - Force a certain random constitution vote

1.6 General election
	- Add intro animation
	- Add outro animation

1.7 Map controls
	- Add popularity view that shows absolute popularity through policies per district
	- Add density view

1.8 Save / Load games
	- Make it possible to save games
	- Make save states loadable
	- One save state is enough to start (to avoid additional menu)

1.9 Main menu
	- Add main menu with options:
		- Start new game
		- Load game
		- Quit to Desktop

1.10 Game setup screen
	- Add a game screen that appears after clicking "start new game" in the main menu.
	- It should contain elements:
		- Party Name Input
		- # Opponents Slider
		- Difficulty Dropdown (opponents will get policy points per cycle depending on this)
		- Start Game Button

1.11 In-Game menu tab
	- Add ingame menu tab with some buttons:
		- Save Game
		- Quit to Main Menu
		- Quit to Desktop

1.12 Parliament tab
	- Add popular vote calculation
	- Add popular vote display


ToDo for Pre-Alpha 0.2 - UI Improvements
----------------------------------
Add modifiers to default popularity calculation

Add simple tooltip with only text
	- add that tooltip to icon buttons and icons

Add mentality with negative impact for testing reasons

Pre-Alpha 0.3 - Map Improvements
----------------------------------

Improve district labels on map:
	- add amount of seats
	- add last winner (with small % lbale with margin)
	- maybe 4 small icons for religion/density/age/language
	- maybe popularity

Add party icons:
	- add option to choose them in lobby
	- display in parliament
	- display in map legend
	- display in district labels
	- display in recent winner
	- maybe display as texture in political overlay

Add framework for repeating overlay textures on map:
	- use to display biomes (very slight as background)
	- use for party overlay with icons

Add animated impact textures for map when overlay is active

Add particle effects that appear over district:	
	- happy smileys when doing something with positive effect (depending on impact)
	- unhappy smileys when doing something negative

Pre-Alpha 0.4 - Content Improvements
----------------------------------
geography changes:
	- add biomes as traits and policies
	- add flat/hilly/mountanous

demography changes:
	- maybe add more granular breakdown (distribute random 5% steps 20 times, then impact based on % of that age group: <= 10% no impact, 15% - 25% low impact, 30% - 40% medium impact, >= 45% high impact)
	- maybe add more granular languaga breakdown (1 langugae (high impact), 2 languages (both medium impact), 2 languages (high and low), 3 langugaes (all low))

mentality changes:
	- add probabilities to mentalities for them to appear
	- add new: [economy] exporter: [economy] policy will also have a low impact on adjacent district (can't be on districts wo neighbours, must be economy that the district has)
	- add new:[religion] fanatics: [religion] policy impact is doubled. all other religion policies have a small negative impact
	- add new: growing population: population will increase each turn which may lead to more seats as the game goes on
	- add new: declining population: population will decrease each turn which may lead to more seats as the game goes on
	- fix rebellious mentality: atm 2 different get the malus instead of only winner with 8 players

implement trust system as win condition:
	- all parties start with 100 trust
	- every district vote adds the amount of seats of that district as trust to the winning party and removes the amount as trust from all the other parties
	- once a party reaches 0 trust, it is eliminated
	- last party that has trust, wins
