- introduce district policies (only affect one district with very high impact)

- add more district traits that are directly usable by players (like linguistic, religous, etc.)
- add new traits from suggestion:
mentality changes:
	- add probabilities to mentalities for them to appear
	- add new: [economy] exporter: [economy] policy will also have a low impact on adjacent district (can't be on districts wo neighbours, must be economy that the district has)
	- add new:[religion] fanatics: [religion] policy impact is doubled. all other religion policies have a small negative impact
	- add new: growing population: population will increase each turn which may lead to more seats as the game goes on
	- add new: declining population: population will decrease each turn which may lead to more seats as the game goes on
	- fix rebellious mentality: atm 2 different get the malus instead of only winner with 8 players

- remove age group (?)
- add density map control
- more geography traits (coastal, biome)

- move religion to def system
- move language to def system
- move economies to def system
- assigned fixed colors to all of the above and use those in legend

- elevation traits (?)
- make economy traits more dependent on geogeaphy (mining / fishing, etc)

- add more ways in battle royale to gain/lose legitimacy. right now many parties are eliminated at the same time and it very quickly goes from 8 to over. end game with less parties should be longer. maybe legitimacy bonus for all other parties on eliminations? or locked behind new party campaign mechanics with unique passive and active effects.

- fix multiplayer hosting error
- fix region highlight shader resetting from time to time

- additional district voting system "proportional" besides "winner takes it all" that affects how seats are distributed.

- fix invalid seeds (see MapEditor.txt)
