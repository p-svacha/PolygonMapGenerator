		- add hover effect to see additional infos of party (name, maxed policies, identity)

add bot difficulty rule to lobby

add mentality with negative effect for testing

Pre-Alpha 0.3 - Map Improvements
----------------------------------

(/) Improve district labels on map:
	- add amount of seats
	- add last winner (with small % lbale with margin)
	- maybe 4 small icons for religion/density/age/language
	- maybe popularity

(/) Add framework for repeating overlay textures on map:
	- use to display biomes (very slight as background)
	- use for party overlay with icons

(/) Add particle effects that appear over district:	
	- happy smileys when doing something with positive effect (depending on impact)
	- unhappy smileys when doing something negative

(/) Allow moving camera of map:
	- Current camera will define boundaries of allowed movement (bounds and zoom)
	- zooming in and moving within those boundaries should be allowed

Add Democracy 4 like impact animations. 
	- When hovering with mouse over a policy, slowly fade out all unaffected districts.
	- Draw arrows with the impact to the affected ones.

Add Textures to map to display economies.


Pre-Alpha 0.4 - Content Improvements
----------------------------------
geography changes:
	- add biomes as traits and policies
	- add flat/hilly/mountanous

demography changes:
	- maybe add more granular breakdown (distribute random 5% steps 20 times, then impact based on % of that age group: <= 10% no impact, 15% - 25% low impact, 30% - 40% medium impact, >= 45% high impact)
	- maybe add more granular languaga breakdown (1 langugae (high impact), 2 languages (both medium impact), 2 languages (high and low), 3 langugaes (all low))

mentality changes:
	- add probabilities to mentalities for them to appear
	- add new: [economy] exporter: [economy] policy will also have a low impact on adjacent district (can't be on districts wo neighbours, must be economy that the district has)
	- add new:[religion] fanatics: [religion] policy impact is doubled. all other religion policies have a small negative impact
	- add new: growing population: population will increase each turn which may lead to more seats as the game goes on
	- add new: declining population: population will decrease each turn which may lead to more seats as the game goes on
	- fix rebellious mentality: atm 2 different get the malus instead of only winner with 8 players

implement trust system as win condition:
	- all parties start with 100 trust
	- every district vote adds the amount of seats of that district as trust to the winning party and removes the amount as trust from all the other parties
	- once a party reaches 0 trust, it is eliminated
	- last party that has trust, wins
