1. Known issues in map generation

- When a polygon is split and the split is starting on a 3-way junction where 1 polygon is water, then the water polygon turns into land after the split
- It is possible to merge 2 polygons so that the new polygon fully engulves another polygon, this should not be allowed
- In very rare cases the map generation results in a stackoverflow in the function FindPolygon
- In very rare cases polygons are created with extremely shard edges (like 1° angles)


2. High prio bugfixes

- PROBABLY FIXED: parallel lines that are exactly at angle of z axis create distorted borders (maybe mistake in RotateVector?)
- in very rare cases border meshes still get distorted (at exactly 90°?)

3. big features to add

- merge should treat first polygon as source and the resulting polygon should inherit all attributes from source
- split and merge should only recalculate the affected regions
- give nations a name upon creation
- improved labeling of polygons and polygon groups: https://observablehq.com/@veltman/centerline-labeling
- biomes according to temperature and humidity distribution (see SavingPlanetX)
- TurnToWater & TurnToLand Buttons
