1. Known issues in map generation

- When a polygon is split and the split is starting on a 3-way junction where 1 polygon is water, then the water polygon turns into land after the split
- It is possible to merge 2 polygons so that the new polygon fully engulves another polygon, this should not be allowed


2. High prio bugfixes

- make coast borders on the outside (on the water) to prevent overlap with nation borders
- new function (FindClusters) that splits a list of polygons into clusters, already implemented in landmass indentification
	- use new function to split nation into clusters before generating border meshes
- fix adjacency overlay for multiple selection
- parallel lines that are exactly at angle of z axis create distorted borders (maybe mistake in RotateVector?)
- in very rare cases border meshes still get distorted (probably impossible to fix)

3. big features to add

- zoom and moving
- merge should treat first polygon as source and the resulting polygon should inherit all attributes from source
- split and merge should only recalculate the affected regions
- give nations a name upon creation
- improved labeling of polygons and polygon groups: https://observablehq.com/@veltman/centerline-labeling
- when creating a nation with a region of another nation, remove that region from the other nation (recalculate border meshes and name labeling)
- biomes according to temperature and humidity distribution (see SavingPlanetX)
