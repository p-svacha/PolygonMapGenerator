1. Known issues in map generation

- Sometimes SplitPolygon > FindPolygonsFromNode > FindPolygon leads to a stack overflow
- When a polygon is split and the split is starting on a 3-way junction where 1 polygon is water, then the water polygon turns into land after the split
- It is possible to merge 2 polygons so that the new polygon fully engulves another polygon, this should not be allowed
- In very rare cases the map generation results in a stackoverflow in the function FindPolygon
- In very rare cases polygons are created with extremely sharp edges (like 1° angles)
	- if not possible to fix: just make border creation detect those angles and act accordingly to avoid spikes
- Sometimes FindOuterBorder does not work, search for "<=2" in PolygonMapFunctions and see comment


2. High prio bugfixes

- rivers with parallel lines sometimes get distorted
- parralel lines that are also parallel to z axis don't register as parallel
- HAVEN'T SEEN THIS IN A WHILE: in very rare cases border meshes still get distorted (at exactly 90°?)


3. big features to add

- make temperature / precipitation / continent noise scale with map size
- add options for low/high temp, low/high precip, small/big continents
- new "continents" mode with noise continental style
- dropdown for topology type (region, island, continents)
- mountain ranges
- add names to landmarks (lakes, islands, peninsulas, straights, deserts, forests)
- make nation borders semi-transparent
- PROBABLY NOT POSSIBLE: region altering functions should only recalculate the affected regions and not redraw the whole map (split/merge/turntoland/turntowater)
- give nations a name upon creation with the new neural network name generator
- textures for different biomes instead of plain colors
- smooth texture shading between textures between regions
- make the shader possible to handle transparent color overlays1
