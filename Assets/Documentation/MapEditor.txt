1. Known issues in map generation

- When a polygon is split and the split is starting on a 3-way junction where 1 polygon is water, then the water polygon turns into land after the split
- It is possible to merge 2 polygons so that the new polygon fully engulves another polygon, this should not be allowed
- In very rare cases the map generation results in a stackoverflow in the function FindPolygon
- In very rare cases polygons are created with extremely sharp edges (like 1° angles)
- Sometimes FindOuterBorder does not work, search for "<=2" in PolygonMapFunctions and see comment


2. High prio bugfixes

- PROBABLY FIXED: parallel lines that are exactly at angle of z axis create distorted borders (maybe mistake in RotateVector?)
- in very rare cases border meshes still get distorted (at exactly 90°?)

3. big features to add

- PROBABLY NOT POSSIBLE: region altering functions should only recalculate the affected regions and not redraw the whole map (split/merge/turntoland/turntowater)
- give nations a name upon creation with the new neural network name generator
- biomes according to temperature and humidity distribution (see SavingPlanetX)
- rivers
- textures for different biomes instead of plain colors
- smooth texture shading between textures between regions
- make the shader possible to handle transparent color overlays
