# About
A Unity project that creates 2d polygonial maps. What this means is that according to specified parameters, it will return a map that is splitted into random polygonial regions and continents. Using this generator, the project also includes some games and simulations using that generator. Each of the main projects contains its own scene in Unity. A small explanation for the main projects can be found in the chapters below.

# Map Editor
The map editor can be used to create the maps and try different parameters. The following screenshots show some features of the map editor.
